# handball-rapm
An initial effort to build out regularized adjusted plus-minus in team handball.

# Background
The Men's EHF EURO 2020 Championship was the first handball event I came across that had "Lineup Report" files that easily provide line efficencies. Here is an example of one for the [championship game](https://livecache.sportresult.com/node/binaryData/HBL_PROD/HBEC20M/PDF_P65LU.PDF). While these are not exactly machine readable, this provides us with a tremendous starting point to build out at least a first attempt a regularized adjusted plus-minus (RAPM) for a handball tournament/league. While a single tournament, even one of the bigger ones like EUROs might be too small of a sample for RAPM, I figured it would still be a valuable exercise and can help get the ball rolling on handball analytics.

# Info
There are thre main steps to generating RAPM here:
- Data: Downloading the lineup reports
- Parsing: Parsing them into a usable state
- Calculations: Generating RAPM values
